# todoAndWeatherApp
Simple Todo and Weather App (Vanilla JS)

The weather and todo list apps are very common amongst front-end developers, who wish to start practicing their skills in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
This project allows a user to do the following:

1. Fetch current weather data from the API offered by https://openweathermap.org/, and update styling in response to weather conditions. Also, as an extra feature, the entered country's flag is fetched from the API offered by https://www.countryflags.io.
2. Add, edit, delete notes/events to the daily event list. The list is stored on user's computer using LocalStorage(), so the data is not lost after closing the tab.
